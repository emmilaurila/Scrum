The project's instructions were clear and easy to understand. The project itself was quite simple.
Everything in the project went well.
I don't think my team's estimates and sprint planning were realistic, but they might still be possible to execute.
My product owner was good.
It's a good way to plan a project.
Product owner, Scrum master and the development team are the roles included in Scrum projects. The Product owner gives User Stories and represents the customer. The Scrum master makes sure that the project progresses. The development team does all the technical stuff, for example, coding.
