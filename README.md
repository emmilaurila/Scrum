The project's instructions were clear and easy to understand. The project itself was quite simple.
Everything in the project went well, but I think that I should have made the PowerPoint better.
I don't think my team's estimates and sprint planning were realistic, but they might still be possible to execute.
My product owner was good, he helped the team with understanding the User Story and gave us more ideas.
Scrum seems like a good way to plan a project. It's simple and doesn't need a lot of effort, just a basic plan.
Product owner, Scrum master and the development team are the roles included in Scrum projects. The Product owner gives User Stories and represents the customer. The Scrum master makes sure that the project progresses. The development team does all the technical stuff, for example, coding.
